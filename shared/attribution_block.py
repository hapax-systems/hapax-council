deviation matrix (V5 weave wk1 d4 PUB-CITATION-A — epsilon).

Surface-aware adapter wrapping :class:`agents.authoring.byline.Byline`
+ :class:`agents.authoring.byline.BylineVariant`. Two-axis attribution:

  * ``BylineVariant`` (V0-V5) — byline shape (solo / 2-way / 3-way /
    PROTO / Hapax-canonical / unsettled-celebration). Owned by
    ``agents.authoring.byline``.
  * ``UnsettledContributionVariant`` (V1-V5) — sentence variant for
    framing the contribution boundary as a celebrated polysemic-
    surface channel. Owned here.

The :data:`SURFACE_DEVIATION_MATRIX` declares for each of the 16
publication surfaces (V5 weave § 2.1 PUB-CITATION-A) which byline +
unsettled-contribution variant pair fits that surface's policy /
aesthetic register. Operator-reviewable; CODEOWNERS protects this
file once landed.

Per V5 weave § 12 invariant 6: every artifact carries the appropriate
V0-V5 byline + V1-V5 unsettled-contribution sentence per
SURFACE_DEVIATION_MATRIX. No hidden co-authorship; no
false-solo-attribution.

Wk1 d4 (this scaffold): API + V1-V5 sentence templates + 16-surface
matrix seed. Wk2+ adjustments after operator review of per-surface
landings.
