"""Intake fit-scorer — the demand-side magnitude feeding the dispatch rank-key.

``plan_dispatches`` ranks each lane's eligible tasks by aged WSJF alone; this module adds a
demand-shape term — a ``fit_score`` derived from the decomposer-written 8-dim
``requirement_vector`` — behind a default-off blend flag. It is the demand-side input to the
eventual (1)↔(2) ``re_route`` loop; this slice wires that signal (+ its telemetry emit), not
the engine itself — ``SdlcRouter.route`` remains unwired into dispatch (a follow-on slice).

Honesty about what this score IS and is NOT (adversarial review 2026-07-04):

* It is a **task-level demand magnitude** — the mean demand over the task's *active*
  non-``quality_floor`` dimensions (score ``> 0``), on the engine's ``0..5`` scale.
* It is **NOT** a projection of the engine's per-(task, candidate) ``requirement_fit``
  (``shared.sdlc_router.SdlcRouter._score_candidate``). That quantity averages the
  *candidate's capability_scores* over the task's active demand dims — it is irreducibly
  per-(task, route) and has no task-only form. This scorer shares only the ``0..5`` scale,
  the ``quality_floor`` exclusion, and the ``>0`` "active dimension" filter (the engine's
  ``_scored_requirement_dimensions``) — the demand side of the same taxonomy, not a shadow
  of the engine's supply-side score.

The ``>0`` active-dim filter is load-bearing for correctness: a *focused-hot* task
(one dim at 5, the rest 0) must rank ABOVE a *diffuse-medium* task (every dim at 3) under a
positive blend — averaging in the zero dims would invert that (0.71 vs 3.0), rewarding
diffuse demand over concentrated critical demand. ``quality_floor`` is excluded for the same
reason the engine excludes it — a hard floor enforced as a veto, not a soft score.

Honest-DARK (mirror of iter-1's ``_parse_requirement_vector``): an absent, partial, or
non-strict-int vector yields ``0.0`` and exerts zero influence when blended. The scorer
NEVER raises (a hostile mapping's iteration is caught and treated as DARK) and NEVER returns
NaN/inf — it is evaluated inside the dispatch rank-key, where a crash or a poisoned sort key
would break the scheduler. Out-of-range and bool values are excluded per-dimension (bool is a
subclass of int but is not a strict-int score), never coerced.

The composite rank-key's golden guarantee: ``blend == 0.0`` short-circuits to ``wsjf_eff``
EXACTLY (returned by identity, not ``wsjf + 0.0 * fit``) so the dispatch plan is byte-identical
to the pre-blend behavior under the default-off flag — the permanent shadow-diff discipline
(``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-30-sdlc-frictionless-self-direction-design.md`` §audit C4).
The short-circuit also makes the blend=0 path immune to a NaN/inf ``fit``.
