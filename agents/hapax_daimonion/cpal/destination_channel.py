"""CPAL TTS destination routing.

The PipeWire split (``~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/hapax-stream-split.conf``)
creates two sinks:

* ``hapax-livestream`` → Studio 24c LEFT (public utterances, music,
  anything broadcast-bound).
* ``hapax-private`` → Studio 24c RIGHT (sidechat replies, debug narration,
  operator-private).

Every Hapax TTS utterance gets classified into one of these destinations
at synthesis time. The default stays ``livestream`` (matching the
systemd drop-in ``HAPAX_TTS_TARGET=hapax-livestream``); only utterances
the operator explicitly initiated via the sidechat (or that are debug /
TEXTMODE+sidechat) divert to the private sink.

**Classification rules** (order matters — first match wins):

1. Impingement ``source`` starts with ``"operator.sidechat"`` → PRIVATE.
2. Impingement ``content["channel"] == "sidechat"`` → PRIVATE.
3. Impingement ``content["kind"] == "debug"`` → PRIVATE.
4. ``voice_register == TEXTMODE`` AND the impingement was sidechat-origin
   (covered by 1/2 above; the register alone does not flip destination).
5. Otherwise → LIVESTREAM.

The register gate (rule 4) is intentionally subordinate: TEXTMODE can
be set by HOMAGE packages unrelated to sidechat (e.g., a BitchX lineage
announcement); those still belong on the livestream. Only when TEXTMODE
coincides with a sidechat-origin impingement do we route private — and
rules 1/2 already catch that case.

**Feature flag**: ``HAPAX_TTS_DESTINATION_ROUTING_ACTIVE`` (default ``1``).
Setting ``0`` forces every utterance to ``HAPAX_TTS_TARGET`` (legacy
single-sink behavior), bypassing classification entirely.

**Telemetry**: Prometheus counter ``hapax_tts_destination_total{destination}``
increments on every classification. The classification is also logged at
INFO level; the log message never contains the utterance body or
operator-identifying content, only the chosen destination and a short
provenance tag.
