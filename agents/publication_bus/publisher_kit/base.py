"""V5 publication-bus Publisher ABC (one-shot publish-on-demand).

Per V5 weave §2.1 PUB-P0-B keystone. Three load-bearing invariants
every v5 publisher enforces, all baked into the superclass
``publish()`` method so subclasses cannot opt out:

1. Allowlist gate (:class:`AllowlistGate.permits`)
2. Legal-name-leak guard (``assert_no_leak``) — only when
   ``requires_legal_name`` is False (rare-case opt-in for formal-
   required surfaces like Zenodo creators array)
3. Counter (Prometheus per-surface per-result)

Subclass shape is ~80 LOC: surface metadata as ClassVar + ``_emit()``
override.

Distinction from v4 ``shared.governance.publisher_kit.BasePublisher``:
- v4 is a JSONL-event-tailing daemon: subclass overrides
  ``compose(event)`` + ``send(composed)``; suitable for cross-surface
  social posting (bsky / mastodon / arena / discord) where events
  stream from a queue.
- v5 (this module) is one-shot publish-on-demand: subclass overrides
  ``_emit(payload)``; suitable for capacity-surface long-form
  publication (Zenodo, OSF, philarchive) where each artifact is
  published once-per-version on operator-trigger.

Both ABCs share the same three invariants. Cross-surface publishers
stay on v4; new long-form publishers use v5.
