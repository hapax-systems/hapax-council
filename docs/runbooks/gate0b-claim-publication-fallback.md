# Gate-0B Claim Publication Fallback

Use this runbook only when the default `cc-claim` admitted publication path is
blocked and the operator explicitly authorizes a temporary legacy claim write.
Default mode is the repair target. The fallback does not produce an admitted
claim-publication receipt, so it must not satisfy admitted close or future
machine-authorizing paths.

## Default Recheck

Manual claims have a built-in producer. A hand-run default claim with no
dispatch flags issues a self-witnessed manual binding bound to the task
`authority_case`, claimer role, and session id. The sidecar keeps the installed
Gate-0B carrier route fields (`platform=codex`, `mode=headless`,
`profile=ultra`) and distinguishes manual provenance with
`manual-cc-claim:*` message/idempotency roots plus the self-witnessed binding
hash.

```bash
cc-claim <task-id>
```

For an isolated behavioral recheck from the repository root:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
smoke_home="$(mktemp -d /tmp/hapax-gate0b-default-recheck.XXXXXX)"
trap 'rm -rf "$smoke_home"' EXIT
HOME="$smoke_home" UV_LINK_MODE=copy scripts/hapax-fsm-smoke --mode default
```

Expected result: the smoke prints the default admitted claim path, manual
binding, first-use install, admitted publication, normal close, claim-after-close
dispatch-only residue archival, and second admitted publication.

For a live default claim, assert the expected sidecars and receipts after
`cc-claim <task-id>`:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
task_id='<task-id>'
lane="${HAPAX_AGENT_ROLE:-${CODEX_ROLE:-${CLAUDE_ROLE:-<lane>}}}"
session="${HAPAX_SESSION_ID:-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-<session-id>}}"
cache_dir="$HOME/.cache/hapax"
install_root="$HOME/.local/share/hapax/execution-invocations/gate0b-claim-publish-v1"
dispatch_file="$cache_dir/cc-claim-dispatch-$lane-$session.json"
test -f "$dispatch_file" || dispatch_file="$cache_dir/cc-claim-dispatch-$lane.json"
test -f "$dispatch_file"
test -f "$install_root/activation-receipt.json"
test "$(head -n1 "$cache_dir/cc-active-task-$lane")" = "$task_id"
test "$(head -n1 "$cache_dir/cc-active-task-$lane-$session")" = "$task_id"
receipt_hash="$(
  python - "$dispatch_file" "$task_id" "$lane" "$session" <<'PY'
import json
import re
import sys
from pathlib import Path

record = json.loads(Path(sys.argv[1]).read_text(encoding="ascii"))
task_id, lane, session = sys.argv[2:5]
assert record["task_id"] == task_id
assert record["lane"] == lane
assert record["session_id"] == session
assert record["dispatch_message_id"].startswith("manual-cc-claim:")
assert str(record["coord_dispatch_idempotency_key"]).startswith("manual-cc-claim:")
assert record["platform"] == "codex"
assert record["mode"] == "headless"
assert record["profile"] == "ultra"
assert re.fullmatch(r"[0-9a-f]{64}", record["binding_hash"])
assert re.fullmatch(r"[0-9a-f]{64}", record["receipt_hash"])
print(record["receipt_hash"])
PY
)"
test -f "$cache_dir/claim-publication-receipts/$receipt_hash.json"
```

Expected result: every command exits zero. The dispatch sidecar is manual
provenance, the content-addressed install receipt exists, both activation
sidecars name the claimed task, and the admitted receipt named by the binding is
present.

First use on a host installs the Gate-0B claim-publication composition root for
the current `HOME` and then publishes the admitted claim. The install is
content-addressed and idempotent for exact matching files. A corrupt,
noncanonical, or mismatched receipt/manifest HOLDs; `cc-claim` does not
overwrite non-matching install artifacts.

The admitted writer stages the task note, epoch sidecars, and dispatch-binding
sidecars first. It persists the content-addressed claim-publication receipt
before constructing or publishing any `cc-active-task-*` activation file. If a
normal close leaves terminal dispatch-only residue, the next admitted
`cc-claim` archives that residue under the old task's `_lineage/` before
publishing the fresh claim.

Governed dispatch may still pass an explicit dispatch-issued binding:

```bash
HAPAX_CLAIM_DISPATCH_MESSAGE_ID='<dispatch-message-id>' \
HAPAX_CLAIM_DISPATCH_BINDING_HASH='<64-hex-binding-hash>' \
HAPAX_CLAIM_DISPATCH_PLATFORM='<platform>' \
HAPAX_CLAIM_DISPATCH_MODE='<mode>' \
HAPAX_CLAIM_DISPATCH_PROFILE='<profile>' \
HAPAX_CLAIM_DISPATCH_AUTHORITY_CASE='<authority-case>' \
HAPAX_CLAIM_DISPATCH_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY='<idempotency-key>' \
cc-claim <task-id>
```

If default mode holds on install corruption or stale claim state, repair that
condition and rerun `cc-claim`. Do not switch to the fallback for routine
stale-claim cleanup.

## Emergency Fallback

```bash
HAPAX_GATE0B_CLAIM_PUBLICATION_OFF=1 cc-claim <task-id>
```

Expected stderr must include `HAPAX_GATE0B_CLAIM_PUBLICATION_OFF=1` and
`using legacy claim writer`. If that warning is absent, stop and inspect the
script version before mutating source.

## Verify Fallback

Check both legacy role-keyed and governed session-keyed cache files:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s nullglob
task_id='<task-id>'
lane="${HAPAX_AGENT_ROLE:-${CODEX_ROLE:-${CLAUDE_ROLE:-<lane>}}}"
vault_active="$HOME/Documents/Personal/20-projects/hapax-cc-tasks/active"
task_notes=()
test -f "$vault_active/$task_id.md" && task_notes+=("$vault_active/$task_id.md")
for candidate in "$vault_active/$task_id-"*.md; do
  task_notes+=("$candidate")
done
test "${#task_notes[@]}" -gt 0
task_note="${task_notes[0]}"
matches=()
for claim_file in "$HOME"/.cache/hapax/cc-active-task-"$lane"*; do
  observed_task="$(head -n1 "$claim_file")"
  test "$observed_task" = "$task_id" && printf '%s\n' "$claim_file"
  test "$observed_task" = "$task_id" && matches+=("$claim_file")
done
test "${#matches[@]}" -gt 0
test -f "$task_note"
rg -q "^status: claimed$" "$task_note"
rg -q "^assigned_to: $lane$" "$task_note"
relay_files=("$HOME"/.cache/hapax/relay/*.yaml)
rg -q "HAPAX_GATE0B_CLAIM_PUBLICATION_OFF=1|operator-authorized emergency fallback|using legacy claim writer" \
  "$task_note" "${relay_files[@]}"
```

Expected result: at least one exact `cc-active-task-$lane*` path is printed,
the resolved task note (`active/<task-id>.md` or `active/<task-id>-*.md`)
contains `status: claimed` and `assigned_to: $lane`, and the operator log or
relay records why the non-admitted fallback was used. If any command exits
nonzero, the fallback did not produce a complete legacy claim or the operator
reason is missing.

Record why the fallback was used in the task session log or relay status. The
verification proves only a legacy claim write; it is not admitted-publication
evidence.

## Governed Release Of Claim Residue

A role wedged by its own claim residue releases it itself, without operator scripts:

```bash
cc-claim --release-claim-residue <task-id>
```

Name the task the residue names; the claim HOLD prints the exact command. The release acts
only on the calling role's residue for that task. Every file it touches must equal the
after-image of a claim-publication journal of that role and task, and must be one of that
journal's own session sidecars. It holds the role's publication lock. It moves each file out of
its live name, and copies the moved bytes, verified, into
`_lineage/<task-id>/claim-residue-release-<stamp>-<role>/` (with a README). It never unlinks
anything, and never touches the task note. It covers four shapes:

| Shape | What is left | What the release does |
|-------|--------------|-----------------------|
| `held_publication` (M166, M167) | A `recovery_required` journal whose note has moved past both of its images, so recovery holds on a projection conflict. Epoch and dispatch sidecars exist; the markers were never written. | Archives the sidecars, then quarantines the journal in place as `claim-pub-<sha>.quarantined-<stamp>`. |
| `lapsed_lease` (M168) | Epoch and dispatch sidecars with no `cc-active-task-*` marker; the next claim holds on `claim_cache_missing`. | Archives the sidecars. |
| `closed_task` (M173) | Markers, epochs and dispatch naming a row that another process closed (it is terminal and absent from `active/`); the next claim holds on `claim_task_mismatch`. | Archives all six sidecars. |
| `reassigned_task` | Markers naming an active row whose note no longer names this role (re-offered or reassigned). Every other role's claim or resume of it refuses on them. | Archives all six sidecars, run by the lane that owns them. |

It refuses, with exit 8 and a named `claim_residue_*` reason, before the first mutation (except
`live-differed`, below):
- on a live claim (a marker naming a task that is not closed, or another session's marker for it);
- on a sidecar that differs from the journal;
- on a journal that recovery can still finish, or whose admission evidence drifted;
- when the calling role has no journal for the task.

A released row whose note still reads `claimed` by the role stays that way; the release never
edits it.

Recheck after a release (the output decides the next step):

```bash
role="${HAPAX_AGENT_ROLE:?}"
ls -la ~/.cache/hapax/ | grep -E "cc-(active-task|claim-epoch|claim-dispatch)-${role}(-|\.json|$)" || echo "no sidecars left for ${role}"
ls ~/Documents/Personal/20-projects/hapax-cc-tasks/_lineage/<task-id>/ | grep claim-residue-release-
cc-claim --recover-claim-publications <task-id>   # expect no hold; a quarantined journal is skipped
cc-claim <next-task-id>                           # expect the claim to publish
```

Nothing is ever unlinked. Each sidecar is moved, atomically and inside the cache's own filesystem,
into `~/.cache/hapax/claim-residue-release/<task-id>/<stamp>-<role>/`. The bytes actually moved are
what is compared with the journal and what is copied, verified, into the lineage. The vault can be
a different filesystem (on appendix it is an NFS mount), so it is never the rename target. A
`<name>.live-differed-from-journal` file in the lineage means a sidecar changed during the
release. The moved bytes are kept in both places, the README records it, and the release stopped
before the journal; inspect them before rerunning.

**Emergency path.** The release has no override flag and no bypass. If it refuses and the operator
decides the residue must go anyway, the Manual Stale-Lease Release below is the emergency path,
run with operator approval and recorded in the row's lineage.

## Manual Stale-Lease Release

Use this manual procedure only with operator approval, and only for the shape the governed release
refuses: an **expired** claim HOLD (exit 7) that names an exact `cc-active-task-*` path whose task
is still live. For the four shapes above, use `cc-claim --release-claim-residue` instead.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
claim_file='<absolute-cc-active-task-path>'
claim_file="$(realpath -e "$claim_file")"
claim_base="$(basename "$claim_file")"
case "$claim_base" in
  cc-active-task-*) ;;
  *) echo "not a cc-active-task path: $claim_file" >&2; exit 2 ;;
esac
claim_key="${claim_base#cc-active-task-}"
task_id="${task_id:-$(head -n1 "$claim_file" | tr -d '[:space:]')}"
test -n "$task_id"
archive_dir="$HOME/Documents/Personal/20-projects/hapax-cc-tasks/_lineage/$task_id/manual-stale-lease-release-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
mkdir -p "$archive_dir"
cache_dir="$HOME/.cache/hapax"
for path in \
  "$claim_file" \
  "$cache_dir/cc-claim-epoch-$claim_key" \
  "$cache_dir/cc-claim-dispatch-$claim_key.json"; do
  if test -e "$path"; then
    archived="$archive_dir/$(basename "$path")"
    tmp_archived="$archive_dir/.copying-$(basename "$path")"
    cp -p -- "$path" "$tmp_archived"
    cmp -s -- "$path" "$tmp_archived"
    mv -f -- "$tmp_archived" "$archived"
    cmp -s -- "$path" "$archived"
    rm -f -- "$path"
    test ! -e "$path"
    test -e "$archived"
  fi
done
printf 'archived stale lease sidecars to %s\n' "$archive_dir"
```

Expected result: the command prints exactly one archive directory, and the
named `claim_file`, matching `cc-claim-epoch-<claim-key>`, and matching
`cc-claim-dispatch-<claim-key>.json` no longer exist in the cache after copies
land in that archive. Then rerun `cc-claim <task-id>`; if it still holds on the
same path, stop and inspect the archive before removing anything else.

If the task id cannot be recovered from the claim file, inspect the matching
`cc-claim-epoch-*` and `cc-claim-dispatch-*.json` files for the same lane or
session key, set `task_id='<recovered-task-id>'`, and rerun the exact-path
procedure. Do not use `cc-close` for another session's stale claim file: it
does not target that file.

## Roll Back To Normal

```bash
unset HAPAX_GATE0B_CLAIM_PUBLICATION_OFF
cc-claim <task-id>
```

If the normal command still holds, repair the Gate-0B install root or release the
legacy claim through the exact stale-lease release procedure before continuing.
