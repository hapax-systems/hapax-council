# Livestream Audio Unified Architecture — Design Spec

**Status:** approved-by-operator (2026-04-23). Supersedes the ad-hoc per-source loudnorm tunings.

**Origin research:** `docs/research/2026-04-23-livestream-audio-unified-architecture.md`

**Goal (operator, verbatim):** "I am CONSTANTLY having to either mess with faders myself or worry about pumping or poor ducking or getting levels adjusted by claude code on the software side. I never want to worry about this again." → Easy to maintain, easy to extend, reliable, excellent listener experience. **One time forever.**

This spec crystallizes the operator-confirmed decisions on top of the research doc. Implementation phases are in the companion plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-livestream-audio-unified-architecture-plan.md`.

## 1. Operator-confirmed decisions (2026-04-23)

| # | Decision | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Egress target = −14 LUFS-I, −1.0 dBTP true-peak.** YouTube-aligned. | Single canonical constant; same value used across stream egress, RTMP encoder, OBS audio mixer. |
| 2 | **All sources route through Evil Pet by default; nothing dry by default.** Routing topology is declarative + per-source overridable in a single config file readable by both operator and Hapax. | Big shift from research-doc draft (which had music bypass Evil Pet). New default: every source → L-12 channel that lands on AUX-B → Evil Pet → broadcast. Override via `dry: true` per source in `config/audio-routing.yaml`. |
| 3 | **Retire `agents/studio_compositor/audio_ducking.py` 4-state FSM and its `hapax-ytube-ducked` / `hapax-24c-ducked` sinks** in Phase 5. | Subsumed by sidechain ducking at the broadcast bus. |
| 4 | **Sidechain envelope detection on `hapax-pn-tts`** as the TTS-active trigger (NOT reviving CPAL `tts_active` SHM publisher). | Fail-open if daimonion crashes; no liveness coupling. |
| 5 | **Notifications stay on Yeti headphone jack only** for now. | Tracked as future-TODO; not a blocker. |
| 6 | **One-time L-12 LINE switch + trim recalibration on CH11/12 during Phase 1 deploy** is fine. | Operator present, 5-minute action. PipeWire restarts during Phase 1+ are also fine **while operator is present** — but see #7. |
| 7 | **NEW: OBS-source survivability across PipeWire restarts is in scope.** When operator is away, PipeWire restart currently forces manual remove + re-add of the OBS audio source. Phase 2 fixes this at the root. | Acceptance: `systemctl --user restart pipewire wireplumber pipewire-pulse` → OBS audio chain is reading the same source name post-restart, no operator touch required. |

## 3. Single source of truth — files

| File | Purpose | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `shared/audio_loudness.py` | All LUFS / dBTP / dB / ms numeric constants. Imported by every audio-touching agent + by config-generator. | spec-controlled |
| `config/audio-routing.yaml` | Per-source declarative policy: `name`, `producer`, `wet|dry`, `pre_norm_target_lufs`, `sidechain_behavior` (`ducked_by` list), `broadcast`, `notes`. | operator + Hapax editable |
| `config/pipewire/generated/*.conf` | PipeWire filter-chain confs **GENERATED** from `audio-routing.yaml` + `shared/audio_loudness.py` by `scripts/generate-pipewire-audio-confs.py`. Never hand-edit. | generated |
| `config/pipewire/hapax-broadcast-master.conf` | The master safety-net (true-peak limiter + ebur128 meter). Derived from constants. | generated |
| `config/pipewire/hapax-obs-ingest.conf` | The string-stable named ingest sink OBS reads. | generated |
| `agents/audio_metering/` | libebur128 sidecar that listens on every named tap, exports Prometheus loudness metrics. | new |

**Hand-edit policy:** the only audio files an operator or Claude session edits are `shared/audio_loudness.py`, `config/audio-routing.yaml`, and the generator script. PipeWire `.conf` regen happens via `scripts/generate-pipewire-audio-confs.py --apply` (writes to `~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/`, hot-reload via `systemctl --user reload pipewire` or restart if needed).

## 4. `shared/audio_loudness.py` schema (Phase 1)

```python
"""Single source of truth for every loudness / dynamics constant in the
livestream audio chain. NEVER hand-tune a sc4m threshold or a hard_limiter
ceiling outside this module — instead change the constant here and re-run
the PipeWire conf generator.
"""

from __future__ import annotations

```

The generator script reads this module, substitutes constants into Jinja-style PipeWire conf templates, and writes the live confs.

## 5. `config/audio-routing.yaml` schema (Phase 6)

```yaml
# Declarative per-source routing policy. Operator + Hapax both edit this.
# Generator script writes the corresponding PipeWire confs.
sources:
  - name: music
    producer: hapax-music-player.service
    pre_norm: true                    # default true
    target_lufs_i: -18.0              # override default (PRE_NORM_TARGET_LUFS_I)
    routing: wet                      # default 'wet' = through Evil Pet via L-12 CH 11/12 → AUX-B
                                      # alternative: 'dry' = direct to broadcast bus
    ducked_by:                        # list of triggers that duck this source
      - operator_voice
      - tts
    broadcast: true                   # appears in master mix
    notes: "Lo-fi/boom-bap pool, oudepode + platform-cleared local sources"

  - name: tts
    producer: hapax-daimonion.service
    pre_norm: true
    routing: wet                       # TTS through Evil Pet for character
    ducked_by: []                      # TTS doesn't get ducked (it's the trigger)
    broadcast: true

  - name: operator_voice
    producer: alsa_input.usb-PreSonus-Studio_24c.mic1
    pre_norm: true
    routing: wet                       # Rode voice through Evil Pet
    ducked_by: []
    broadcast: true

  - name: notifications
    producer: output.loopback.sink.role.notification
    pre_norm: false                    # Yeti monitor, never broadcast
    routing: dry                       # Headphone-only path

```

Adding a new source = 1 commit, 1 file edit. Generator picks it up on next run.

## 6. Phase boundaries (acceptance criteria mapped to numbers)

Detail in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-livestream-audio-unified-architecture-plan.md`. Headlines:

- **Phase 1 — Master safety net + OBS rebind + L-12 trim** (operator-present required)
- **Phase 2 — OBS-restart survivability** (zero-touch PW restart)
- **Phase 3 — Per-source pre-normalizers** (every source → −18 LUFS pre-norm)
- **Phase 4 — Sidechain ducking** (operator-VAD + TTS-active triggers)
- **Phase 5 — Retire `audio_ducking.py` + ducked sinks**
- **Phase 6 — Routing-as-code** (`config/audio-routing.yaml` + generator)
- **Phase 7 — Loudness telemetry** (libebur128 sidecar → Prometheus)
- **Phase 8 — Regression harness** (synthetic-stimulus tests)

## 7. Invariants the design preserves

- L-12 == livestream invariant: anything in L-12 reaches broadcast.
- Operator speech NEVER dropped (AEC, not VAD-frame-drop).
- Hapax-livestream sink is null-sink (no speaker loopback risk).
- Operator's L-12 faders sit at unity and STAY at unity post-Phase-1.
- PipeWire restarts never require operator to touch OBS post-Phase-2.
- Adding/removing a source never requires touching upstream stages.

## 8. Things this spec explicitly does NOT do

- Replace the WirePlumber role-based loopback system. Roles still exist; they're how sources reach the routing layer.
- Touch the AEC pipeline (separate concern; existing solution stays per memory `reference_pipewire_echo_cancel_enotsup_loop` until that's also re-engineered).
- Govern operator-monitor (headphone) audio. That's a separate path, kept on Yeti.
- Govern TTS character (the Voice FX presets). Those remain operator-curated.

## 9. Approval

Confirmed by operator 2026-04-23 with:
> "1. recommended 2. we need to make all pathing dynamic and optional in an easy to manage way for both me and for Hapax. but by default EVERYTHING should go through the evil pet and NOTHING should be dry. 3. y 4. whatever is rec 5. yes, until we have a better solution 6. Yup as long as I am here I don't care about pipewire restarts, just when I am away because I have to manually remove and then re-add the OBS source sink — but maybe we can fix this problem? We DEFINITELY SHOULD."

## §10. USB-IN line-driver — analog-trim substitute (added 2026-05-02)

### Background

Per §3 (master safety-net design) the architecture assumed sources arriving
at the L-12 mixer would benefit from the L-12's per-channel analog LINE IN
TRIM/PAD stage before reaching the channel fader. This assumption holds for
sources connected via TRS/XLR cables to L-12 CH 1-12 analog inputs.

It does NOT hold for sources arriving via USB IN (L-12 USB IN tracks 1-2 →
physical CH 11/12). USB IN bypasses the analog channel-strip TRIM stage
entirely. A source pre-normalized to -18 LUFS-I per `PRE_NORM_TARGET_LUFS_I`
arrives at the operator's "send to AUX (Evil Pet)" rotary at -18 dBFS with
no boost.

When the operator's hardware controls (USB-IN-to-AUX send, Evil-Pet-to-CH6
send) are at unity per the operator policy, the broadcast chain inherits
the -18 dBFS source level minus L-12 wet-path losses (measured 2026-05-02:
27 dB total loss USB IN to broadcast capture).

Operator framing, verbatim:
> "If I have all my operative controls at unity, and the signal coming in
> is incredibly weak, I just killed ALL the headroom."

### Resolution

For each source routed via USB IN, insert a per-source USB line-driver
filter-chain stage between the source's pre-norm output and the L-12 USB
IN sink. Calibrate the line-driver's input gain to substitute for the
missing analog channel-strip trim. Constants live in
`shared/audio_loudness.py` as `WET_PATH_USB_BIAS_<SOURCE>_DB`.

### Per-source bias table (calibrated 2026-05-02)

| Source       | Constant                          | Calibrated value |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| Music        | `WET_PATH_USB_BIAS_MUSIC_DB`      | +27.0 dB         |
| TTS          | `WET_PATH_USB_BIAS_TTS_DB`        | +27.0 dB (reserved, unmeasured) |

### Phase compatibility

The line-driver is downstream of pre-norm. Phase 3 LV2 LUFS-targeting
per-source pre-normalizers replace `hapax-music-loudnorm` (and TTS
equivalent) but DO NOT replace this stage. The bias correction is
independent of the per-source loudness target.

`MASTER_INPUT_MAKEUP_DB` retains its analog-only semantics: it remains
calibrated for sources arriving via L-12 analog LINE IN with the analog
trim active. USB-IN sources route through their per-source line-driver
FIRST, then sum into the broadcast bus where MASTER_INPUT_MAKEUP_DB
applies uniformly.

### Acceptance

- Per-source USB IN paths land at the broadcast capture point at the
  same level as their analog-LINE-IN equivalents would have, when
  operator hardware controls are at unity.
- Master safety-net limiter remains a SAFETY NET, not a primary level
  control.
- Phase 3 LV2 work proceeds without modification to this stage.
