"""cc-close-acceptance-receipt-check — review-floor closure receipt gate.

Routing Phase 0.2 (REQ-20260609): ``frontier_review_required`` is only honest
if acceptance is enforced. Reads a cc-task .md file and returns:

- exit 0 when the task does not declare the review floor (top-level or
  ``route_metadata.quality_floor``) — non-review-floor flows are untouched.
- exit 0 when a valid signed acceptance receipt exists beside the note as
  ``<task_id>.acceptance.yaml`` carrying acceptor, verdict ``accepted``,
  timestamp, and an artifact ref.
- exit 2 when the receipt is missing, malformed, field-incomplete, or its
  verdict is not ``accepted`` — with the precise blockers and next actions
  on stderr.

Used by ``scripts/cc-close`` in the ``done`` path, before the note moves to
closed/. Verdicts other than ``accepted`` block: a rejected review is not a
closeable outcome.

Bypass: ``HAPAX_ACCEPTANCE_RECEIPT_GATE_OFF=1`` (legacy incident response only).
Canon-bound close ignores this raw bypass; governed override evidence belongs in
the shared terminal-close admission rather than an ambient environment variable.

Failure mode: fail-OPEN on infrastructure errors reading the NOTE (missing /
unreadable file — a broken gate must not brick closures), but fail-CLOSED on
receipt problems (an absent or invalid receipt is exactly what this gate
exists to catch).
